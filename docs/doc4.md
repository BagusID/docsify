Before start creating your features such as point, line, or polygon, a Layer needs to created first. A layer works just like a folder. In mapid, layer is needed to edit your layer.

So... before start to create a feature you can click on new layer button.

for an example, after you create your layer, a new layer with *yacob_201872618740.geojson* format will be exist on your flow.

yacob_201872618740.geojson
- username (yacob)
- 2018 (year)
- xxxxxx (feature number)
- .geojson (format extension)

After finish create your first layer, you can start **edit** by click edit on your layer.

If a **pop up blocker** appear, please allow it. Click **OK** after edit layer pop up appear.

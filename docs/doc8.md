## Navigation Bar

geo.mapid.io has 4 main features that are placed on the navigation bar. There are toolbox, details, inspect, and navigate. Each feature are provided for make your work get easier when you want to make geospatial analysis.

### Toolbox

The main function of toolbox feature is to get an elevation from one point, a distance value from one point to another, the large of an area, and a radius from one point. When toolbox feature is used to measure a distance from one point to another, the distance indicator unit can be adjusted as needed, from kilometer, meter and feet.

#### Buffer Line

### Details

Details feature can do the same thing with toolbox feature, but it offers a greater function. Basically, there are several layers on a map, and objects that included in the map. For example, if there are layers of cities in Indonesia, then it will shows the dots symbol for city objects. In the city objects, there are attributes to explain the object. For example, Bandung has the attributes of Province of the West Java. This attribute can produce broader information, such as population data, per capita income data, and many other statistical data.

In details, when you have set which layer to be shown, you can automatically zoom to the layer to know exactly where it is just by clicking to **_zoom to_** under the layer name.


### Inspect

Inspect feature is used to get attributes from the geospatial data that choose by the user with only point a cursor. This feature is use to get more detail information or known as attribute. For example, the picture below shows IoT sensor attributes that we also develop. The information shown is more detail from longitude, latitude, and the last time the sensors make updates.

#### Pop up window to choose which layer to be inspected

### Navigate

Navigate feature enable user to know the route from point A to point B . Supported with a guide, the user can easily access the location they need to go. There are 2 ways to access, by typing the initial location and the destination or clicking on 2 certain points. If you do the second way, what you will get are the coordinates of that 2 points.


#### Navigate feature to get direction from one point to another by clicking 2 different points

#### Navigate feature to get direction from one point to another by typing 2 different places
